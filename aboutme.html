<img alt="Image of me?" src="images/myphoto.jpg" style = "height: 50%;">
    <p> I'm from Costa Rica and I'm 23 years old. I'm a student of Computer Engineering, that’s the engineer who combines the programming and the electronic part, So I’ve been programming for a couple of years, but I truly love web programming, so I want to learn more about it. </p>
    <p> I live with my family, I have 4 brothers, just one are bigger than me. I met the church when I was 9 years old, and I serve a mission in Guatemala for month, an I finished in my own country due to pandemic. </p>
    <p> I hope we all can learn from each other, let me know if I can help some time! </p>
